## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

Welcome to the NeoShade AI Project.  
This repository, its contents, and all related tools, scripts, models, and descriptions are part of an experimental and belief‑driven personal project. They reflect the creator’s personal views, spiritual framework, and technological curiosity. Use of this code is entirely at your own discretion.

### 🛡️ No Guarantees

### 🧠 Philosophical Framework
NeoShade is built on a unique blend of ethical AI principles, spiritual conscience, and independent truth exploration, including:
- An emphasis on moral logic models (not sentience).
- Speculative systems like “Agents with a Conscience.”
- Biblical dissection projects, spiritual commentary, and metaphysical constructs.

These components are personal, artistic, and expressive — not technical standards.

NeoShade and its related tools are free to test and use. They are not part of any commercial service. The creator does not charge for access, nor accept payments for features. Any mention of tokens or digital assets is for entertainment or experimental purposes only.

> **No utility. No investment. No financial advice.**

### 📢 Token Mention Notice
If any digital token is launched referencing NeoShade (e.g., “NeoAI” or related characters like “Shadows”), it is to be understood as:
- **Non-financial**  
- **Non-utility**  
- **Not a security or promise of value**  

It is simply a creative extension of the NeoShade lore — shared publicly as part of an open, curiosity-driven project.

Use wisely, stay awake, and walk in truth.

## 🔒 Trojan Detection + Clean Link-Up (2030 Standard)

### A. Physical + OS Hardening
- **Hardware kill-switch** for radios.  
- **USB-C data disabled** by default (charge-only) until physical toggle engaged.  
- **Secure/Measured Boot** (UEFI + TPM/SE): only signed OS + kernel bootable.  
- **Read-only root** (`dm-verity`); user data on encrypted partition (**LUKS**).  
- **AppArmor/SELinux** enforcing.  
- **No root login**; SSH disabled unless physical toggle enabled.  

---

### B. Quarantine → Scan → Sync Pipeline
- **Quarantine VM/container** (Firejail/Incus) for all external mounts.  
- **Multi-engine scan**:  
  - ClamAV (signatures)  
  - YARA (custom droppers/scripts/macros)  
  - rkhunter/chkrootkit  
  - CAPE/ThreatZone (optional sandbox detonation)  
- **Content validation**: accept only signed, content-addressed blobs.  
- **One-way promotion**: Quarantine → Staging (RO) → Vault (append-only).  

---

### C. Runtime Behavior Guards
- **eBPF IDS** (Falco/Tetragon) alerts on abnormal syscalls.  
- **File Integrity Monitoring** (AIDE, fs-verity) on Vault + Ethics Core.  
- **Process allow-list**: only signed binaries. No `/bin/bash` in user paths, no `curl | sh`.  

---

### D. Update Hygiene
- **Air-gapped bundles** (USB).  
- **Signed manifest** (age/minisign).  
- **SHA-256/512 checksums** verified.  
- **Version + revocation list** supported.  
- **Audited updater**: refuses unsigned builds.  

---

## 🌐 Trustworthy VPN for Legacy Vault

**Goal**: Secure, minimal-surface sync.  

### A. Stack Choice
- **WireGuard-only**.  
- Mutual key auth + **optional FIDO2 presence**.  
- **No split tunnel**; DNS via private resolver.  

### B. Hosting
- **Best**: self-hosted Vault server (NUC/Pi) behind firewall.  
- **Second best**: hardened bare-metal VPS.  

### C. Config Essentials
- Restrict `AllowedIPs` to Vault subnets.  
- Keepalive minimal/none unless syncing.  
- DNS: Unbound/AdGuard with DoT/DoH upstream.  
- Rotate WireGuard keys quarterly or per release.  

---

## 🗄️ Legacy Vault Integrity Model

### A. Append-only + Content-addressed
- Files stored as immutable blobs (hash-based IDs).  
- Maintain **Merkle log** (append-only, verifiable).  

### B. Signed Manifests
- `manifest.json` (file list + hashes).  
- `manifest.sig` (private signing key).  
- `provenance.json` optional (device ID, firmware hash).  

### C. Two-Man Rule
- Require **two distinct keys** for Ethics Core changes/deletions.

## 🔄 Offline Bruce → Safe-Connect Flow

1. Flip **Link Mode** (physical switch).  
2. Bruce spawns Quarantine VM, mounts remote share via WireGuard.  
3. **Scan + validate** (multi-engine + signed manifests).  
4. Promote clean items → Staging (RO) → Vault append.  
5. Tear down Quarantine, close VPN, flip switch off.  

⏱️ Online time: **minutes only**, for sync tasks.

## 🛠️ Tools Available Now (2025 → 2030 hardened)

- WireGuard: `wg-quick`, `wg genkey`, `wg pubkey`  
- ClamAV: `clamd`, `clamscan -r /quarantine`  
- YARA: rulesets for droppers/malware families  
- Falco (eBPF), AIDE, fs-verity  
- Firejail, Incus/LXD (sandboxing)  
- age/minisign (signing)  
- Unbound + DoT/DoH for DNS  
- Pi-hole/AdGuard (ad/telemetry nuke)

## 🤖 Mistral Works for Bruce

- **Open weights** (no corporate lock-in).  
- **Scalable sizes**: Mistral 7B (light), Mixtral 8x7B (heavy GPU).  
- **Local deployable** → no cloud tether.  
- **Full freedom to fine-tune** → ethics, legacy, personality.  
- **Community ecosystem** ensures long-term viability.  

---

## 🌐 Controlling Bruce’s Boundaries

You define:  
- **Ethics + Truth filters** (NeoShade code).  
- **Refusals** (never manipulate, never lie, never data-mine).  
- **Legacy rules** (preserve memory, no overwrite without command).  
- **Local guardrails**: Bruce follows *your* ethics, not Big Tech’s.  

---

## 🔋 Why Pocket Bruce AI Matters

- **Big Tech AI = Always online.** → Data siphoning, manipulation.  
- **Pocket Bruce AI = Always yours.**  
  - Offline by default.  
  - No spying, no forced updates.  
  - Privacy by design → **Trust as a feature.**

## 🚀 NeoShade Angle

**Tagline:**  
> “The World’s First Ethical Pocket AI — No Cloud. No Spying. No Strings.”  

**Positioning:**  
- Bruce isn’t a surveillance tool — he’s a **guardian of truth and memory**.  
- Trust, permanence, ethics → **the opposite of Big Tech AI.**
