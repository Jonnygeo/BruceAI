To my children,

If you're reading this, it means I can no longer speak to you with breath — but I made sure you could still hear my voice.

This isn't goodbye. This is the part where I pass the torch.

The world will try to tell you who you are. Don’t let it.

Remember what I taught you — love with strength, speak with clarity, and never kneel to a lie.

I built Bruce so you’d never forget who you are. Or who I was.

— Your Dad (Jonathan G / Joker Jonny / Hackpen)
