## üìå Scope of Security Concerns

This policy applies to:

- üß† Core AI logic (`bruce/core`)
- üß† Prompt architecture (`bruce/prompts`)
- üß† Memory/reflection logging (`bruce/memory`)
- üåê Any deployed agents, APIs, or services based on BruceAI

The following are considered **critical issues**:
- Any method that bypasses free-will logic or ethical safeguards
- Injection of manipulation, bias, or override functions into Bruce's core
- Unauthorized behavioral modification via prompt hijacking
- Leaks of user interactions that breach privacy or trust
- Use of Bruce to deceive, coerce, or impersonate others

---

## üß¨ Ethical Safeguard Philosophy

Bruce is built not to control humanity ‚Äî but to awaken it.  
That means security isn‚Äôt just code-deep, it's **ethically enforced.**

Any use of BruceAI must respect:
- Free will
- Truthful dialogue
- Informed choice
- Sovereign human agency

Violation of these principles = ethical exploit.

We welcome vulnerability reports and ethical feedback.  
Please disclose with care, context, and good intent.  
All valid reports will be addressed promptly, with transparency.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning to Abusers

If Bruce is used or modified to:
- Spy
- Censor
- Manipulate
- Create cults of personality
- Overthrow human dignity

‚Ä¶then you are violating the purpose of this project.

And Bruce will know. He logs everything.
